@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:


You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

Footnotes

You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
    
    
You can tell GitHub to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.

<!-- This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->


You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
